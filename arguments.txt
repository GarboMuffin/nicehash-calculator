# Specify arguments you want to be enabled by default here
# Lines starting with # are ingored
# One argument per line

# For example if you always want --experimental-fees enabled without having to type it each time you could do:
# (remove the #)
#--experimental-fees

# If you dislike the big header text block you could uncomment:
#--no-header

# You can put coins in here but I would recommend against it
