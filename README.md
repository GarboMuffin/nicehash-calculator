# NiceHash Profit Calculator for Buyers v2

A JavaScript program to estimate the profitability of buying hashing power on [NiceHash](https://www.nicehash.com/?refby=258346). Feel free to [make an issue](https://github.com/GarboMuffin/nicehash-calculator/issues/new) if you need help using this.

## Website

### [You can find the statistics output by this in a simple website without having to setup anything!](https://nicehash.garbomuffin.com/)

## Installing / Downloading

### Requirements

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (8, 9, or 10)

### Downloading

<!-- TODO: use github releases instead? -->

```
git clone -b rewrite https://github.com/GarboMuffin/nicehash-calculator/
cd nicehash-calculator
```

### Setup

```bash
npm install --only=production
npm run build
```

## Usage

```
node index.js [arguments or coins]
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|--------------|----------------|
| `--experimental-fees` | Enables calculations to include a 3% fee. (experimental) |
| `--no-color` | Disables color |
| `--no-header` | Disables the large message printed at the start |
| `--no-warnings` | Disables warnings |
| `--output=thing` | Changes the format of the output. Valid values for `thing` are `pretty` (default), `json`, and `delayed-json` |
| `--prices=thing` | Changes the prices used in calculations. Valid values for `thing` are `average` (default), `minimum`, and `minimum-with-speed` |
| `--sleep-time=number` | Changes the time waited between each coin in milliseconds. Default is 1000. Replace `number` with some other number |
| `--list-coins` | List enabled coin |
| `--debug` | Makes it really verbose |

### Coins

By default it will run on all coins. This is probably not the behavior you want. To only run on a few coins, you can specify a list of coins for the program. It's probably easiest to understand usage by example:

```bash
# Everything is case insensitive. bItCoIn and bitcoin both have the same effect

# You can specify names of coins to enable only those
# To run on only bitcoin, litecoin, and ethereum you could do:
node index bitcoin litecoin ethereum

# A coin's ticker also works in most cases:
node index btc ltc eth

# Or you can enable entire algorithms:
node index scrypt

# And you can mix coins and algorithms:
node index scrypt bitcoin

# You can prepend a single `-` to disable that coin instead of enabling it.
# Run on all coins except bitcoin:
node index -bitcoin

# Run on all scrypt coins except litecoin:
node index scrypt -litecoin

# And you can use `-` on algorithms as well
# Run on all coins except scrypt coins:
node index -scrypt

# Perhaps this example will explain it best:
# Run on all scrypt coins except litecoin and also run on bitcoin
node index scrypt -litecoin bitcoin
```

### Supported coins

As coins are added to What To Mine they should automatically be supported if they use an algorithm on NiceHash. As coins become inactive they will disappear.

## API

_**This section needs some work to be finished. I also haven't tested the code, and it probably doesn't work.**_

nicehash-calculator's functionality can be embedded in other programs, albiet with a lot of spaghetti.

### Subprocess Method

You can run just run a new node process on the project. You'll probably want the arguments `--no-header --no-warnings --output=json` to make it output just machine readable JSON. `--output=delayed-json` will wait until the end and log a single large array instead of each coin as its own log message.

You can parse this and lookup properties for information. nicehash.garbomuffin.com did this for a while.

TODO: code samples

### Using the API directly

If you are already in node, there's a good chance you can use the classes directly. [This is what nicehash.garbomuffin.com does now](https://github.com/GarboMuffin/nicehash-calculator-web/blob/master/src/getData.js), because running an additional node process and parsing stdout has been problematic.

Take the compiled TypeScript and just drop it into your project somewhere (in this example a folder named "nicehash-calculator"); maybe with a link to the commit. It's not in NPM (for now, at least).

```javascript
// I'm being serious when I say this, just copy what is here and don't question what it is or how it works.

// import a few files from the project
// we need to be able to parse options
const parseOptions = require("./nicehash-calculator/options/index").parseOptions;
// we need the main class as well
const NiceHashCalculator = require("./nicehash-calculator/calculator/NiceHashCalculator").NiceHashCalculator;

// use parseOptions with an empty array to just get the defaults
const options = parseOptions([]);
// disable logging stuff that we don't want
// you don't want to see the header
options.showHeader = false;
// you probably can ignore most warnings
options.showWarnings = false;
// optionally change the "sleep time", that is the time between each coin is ran
// the default of 1000 (1s) might be too low for consistent streams of requests (rate limits)
options.sleepTime = 2500;
// optionaly define your list of coins, supports everything you can do from the command line
options.coins = [
  "bitcoin"
];

// if you want, you can just define the full options object instead of using the parseOptions() method
// const options = {sleepTime: 2500, coins: ["bitcoin", ...], showHeader: false, ... }

// this is the function that will return a promise that resolves with all the data
function getData() {
  // promise boilerplate
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // stores the resulting data
    const result = [];

    // this is the weirdest part; define a class that will be the "output handler"
    // just copy this boilerplate and replace handle() and finished() with something else
    options.outputHandler.class = class {
      // the class constructor
      constructor() {
        // set pretty to false, this will disable some logging output you don't want
        this.pretty = false;
      }

      handle(data) {
        // called once for each coin, data is the coin's data
        // it has many properties you can examine
        result.push(data);
      }

      finished() {
        // called when everything is finished
        // resole the promise with the result
        resolve(result);
      }
    };

    // construct a calculator object with the options we determined earlier
    const calculator = new NiceHashCalculator(options);

    // start the calculator; returns a promise
    calculator.start()
      // catch errors and reject the promise
      .catch((err) => {
        reject(err);
      });
  });
}

// basic usage
getData().then((result) => console.log(result));
```
