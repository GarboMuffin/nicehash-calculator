# This is the WIP rewrite of nicehash-calculator

# It doesn't actually work yet

# You shouldn't use it

---

## Things I want to change

- [X] Improve the code
- [X] Support more types of outputs (json output maybe?)
- [ ] Add better support for fixed order (doubt this is gonna happen)
- [ ] Create a website showing the results of this program in an easier to access form.
- [X] Avoid hard coding coins and instead download them from the What To Mine API
- [ ] Includes fees
